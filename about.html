    <h2>Hi, welcome to my little peice of the internet...</h2>
    <p>
      My name Is Ian Bear, most people just call me Bear though.
      On this page you'll find a little bit about me and my story so far.
      You'll also learn what I like to write about and what your likely to find here on this blog.
      Thanks for visiting, I hope to entertain you, even if its only you laughing at me rather than with me!

    <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
    <p>
      On the 22nd of December a little boy was born (it's me) in a sunny city called Durban, in South Africa.
      His parents were filled with joy and excitement, or so they tell me...
      They name him Ian (me) after his great grandfather, Israel, whom he turned out to be nothing like.
      Ian (also me) was a happy but realtively quiet child, only crying when absolutely necessary.

    <h2>A few years later little Ian grows up...</h2>
    <p>
      I always enjoyed my days at school, grabbing myself a 5 destinctions in my final year.
      I also found my love for the stage, acting and singing as often as I could, I even had a band!
      All that earned me scholarship to a top university, but that didn't go quite as I had planned
      As quickly as I arrived, I left, a costly excerise to discover engineering just wasn't my passion

    <h2>Time to turn this story around...</h2>
    <p>
      After a couple of years paying my dues, and student debt, a stroke of luck and some help from an old friend, I landed my first software development job.
      I was overjoyed! I finally got to do something that I geniunly enjoyed for a living.
      It was small company, we all fit on one floor of a converted double story house, but it was the perfect place for me to get my start and cut my teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thrown into the deep end straight away but I loved and it allowed me to grow a software developer at a rapid rate.
      After almost a year, oppertunity struck again and I took it, but I will always remeber my time and the friends I made at this small but passionate company.

    <h2>The big break(s)...</h2>
    <p>
      That oppertunity I got was to work for Derivco, which is one of the largest software development houses in the country, and  I grabbed it with both hands. I felt like I had finally made it.
      Working for Derivco is an incredible experience, I had the job of building tools for my fellow Derivkins, and I abousolutely loved it, even the 2am calls when something important ran into a a hiccup. (Ok, I lied, nobody likes being woken up at 2am)
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to learn so much whilst working there, it's where I first became a software developer, rather than just some guy who knows how to code.
      One of the best things about Derivco is that they offices all over the world and one day I was offered the chance to go and work in the office England, an offer I could never refuse.

    <h2>I just grabbed a suitcase and got on plane...</h2>
    <p>
      So far this the scariest and best thing I've done in my life. Half of me was convinced I'd gone mad for getting a plane heading to a country I'd never been to before, with my entire life in a single suitcase.
      How wrong I was, this experince has grown me so much as person, I wouldn't change a single thing. I have made the most incredible friends, seen absoultly amazing things that I never would have back home, and every day I get to work on an brillant peice software thats going to best the best in the industry.
      I'm so excited for the future, and all of the new and exciting things that I'll get to experince.
